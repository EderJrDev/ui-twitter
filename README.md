🚀 **Description**

UI-Twitter is a project aimed at recreating the Twitter interface using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a similar experience to the actual platform, allowing users to view tweets and interact with the timeline.

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in frontend development, incorporating advanced CSS and JavaScript concepts, and utilizing the React framework to create an attractive and responsive interface.
